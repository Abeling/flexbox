                <p>Joey van Ingen a.k.a. Radical Redemption is the man behind this new name in the hardstyle scene. He's born in 1990, and grew up in the east of the Netherlands. From day one he was interested in all kinds of music.
                At age 10 he started to play the drums. His interest went to the rhythmic elements in music. As drummer he played in several bands, 'Pacific' became his main project. But, at that same time he came in touch with the harder side of dance music. He had to make a choice...</p>

                <p>Some people are destined to be an artist. Masters of Hardcore's gorgeous Miss K8 was born in Kiev Ukraine and has been passionate about hard EDM since she first started to listen to music. The very first day she saw deejays play, perform and interact in the Kiev clubs she chose her path and she instantly knew the stage was her domain.

                <h3>Medium Rare</h3>
                <p>Pepijn Hol founded Frequencerz in 2005. He used this alias for the tracks he produced. But since Pepijn was, at that time, not able to perform as a DJ, he started the search for a skilled DJ. This quickly resulted in the second member of the group, Niels Koster. Pepijn and Niels knew each other through the Internet and had developed a close friendship.

                Niels and Pepijn visited a lot of big parties back then and they quickly came to realize that they wanted their music to be more than just a hobby and decided to take their career to the next level. Both of them producing the tracks as well as performing as Frequencerz...</p>

                <h3>Frenchcore Revolution</h3>
                <p>Music lovers all over the world! I'm Steve, better known as Dr. Peacock! I was born in Holland in 1988 and I have been playing music since 2002. I was raised in a small town called Limmen, and that's where it all began. My love and passion for music (specifically Frenchcore and Terror) were realized when I first heard DJ's performing at big hardcore events in Holland. In 2004 I started organizing parties on my own. They were small, but always very crowded and amusing! The club where I had those parties sadly closed due to bankruptcy a few years ago, so I started focusing more on other events...</p>
