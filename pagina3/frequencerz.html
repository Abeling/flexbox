                <p>Pepijn Hol founded Frequencerz in 2005. He used this alias for the tracks he produced. But since Pepijn was, at that time, not able to perform as a DJ, he started the search for a skilled DJ. This quickly resulted in the second member of the group, Niels Koster. Pepijn and Niels knew each other through the Internet and had developed a close friendship.

                Niels and Pepijn visited a lot of big parties back then and they quickly came to realize that they wanted their music to be more than just a hobby and decided to take their career to the next level. Both of them producing the tracks as well as performing as Frequencerz.

                After a lot of experimenting in the studio together, they developed their own style and it didn't take long before other deejays started playing their tracks. Even in this early stage, Frequencerz got some massive support from guys like Deepack and D-Block &amp; S-Te-Fan. Deepack even played Frequencerz â€“ Tomorrow and Beyond while closing down the main stage of Defqon.1 Festival 2008. For Niels and Pepijn this was a sign that they were on the right track and the drive to play the big stages grew even stronger!

                In July 2009 all of their hard work paid off, the legendary Fusion Records made the Frequencerz an offer they couldn't refuse and signed the boys to the label. From here on, things went really fast. Since then Niels and Pepijn have rocked stage after stage, leaving a trail of devastated dance floors behind them. With Defqon.1 Festival 2010, Q-Dance presents Fusion in the amazing Heineken Music Hall, The Qontinent 2010 and Bassleader 2010 being the absolute highlights.

                Also their first release on Fusion Records, "Phaser/Driver", saw the light of day and got hammered by a lot of big deejays.

                With new tracks coming up and a lot of gigs in their schedule, Frequencerz are ready for the future! Are you ready for them?</p>
